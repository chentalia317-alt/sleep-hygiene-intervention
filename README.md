## Project Overview
Modern young adults often experience poor sleep quality due to irregular schedules and pre-bed electronic device use.  
This pilot study explores how simple, low-cost behavioral interventions can improve circadian alignment and subjective alertness.

## Study Design

### **Participants**
Thirty volunteers (aged 18â€“30) were recruited through online communities.  
Each participant gave informed consent and received a unique anonymized ID (P001â€“P030).

### **Experimental Phases**
1. **Baseline (5 days):** Participants maintained their usual sleep routines to establish individual baselines.  
2. **Intervention A â€“ Fixed Sleep Window (7 days):** Participants practiced a consistent sleepâ€“wake schedule and complementary habits such as limiting caffeine intake after noon and maintaining a calm, clean sleep environment.  
3. **Intervention B â€“ No Device Before Bed (7 days):** Participants avoided electronic device use 30 minutes before bedtime, reduced artificial light exposure after 22:30, and increased morning daylight exposure within one hour after waking.

### **Measurements**
- **Subjective sleepiness (KSS):** Reported three times per day (10 AM, 3 PM, 9 PM).  
- **Sleep onset / wake time:** Self-reported and partially verified via wearables.  
- **Task compliance rate:** Number of assigned tasks completed each day (0â€“1 scale).

## Daily Task Structure

### Intervention A â€” Fixed Sleep Window
- **on_time_bed:** Go to bed within the designated time window.  
- **no_caffeine:** Avoid caffeine intake after the afternoon.  
- **clean_environment:** Maintain a tidy, cool, and quiet sleep environment.  

### Intervention B â€” No Device Before Bed
- **no_device:** Refrain from using any electronic devices within 30 minutes before sleep.  
- **reduce_light:** Lower environmental light intensity (after 22:30) before bedtime.  
- **outdoor_light:** Ensure at least 30 minutes of natural daylight exposure  within one hour after getting up.  

Each task was coded as 0/1 and aggregated to compute a **compliance rate** per participant per phase:  

> **Compliance rate = (Number of tasks completed) / (Total assigned tasks)**

This rate served as a proxy for behavioral adherence and was later examined as a covariate when interpreting KSS and sleep-duration changes.

## Data processing & Analysis Pipeline
| Step | Script | Function |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | `01_make_combined.py` | Merge baseline & intervention datasets |
| 2 | `02_stats_delta.py` | Compute Î”KSS / Î”Sleep Duration, perform Welch *t*-test |
| 3 | `03_plot_export.py` | Export boxplots of Î” metrics |

## Methods of Data Processing and Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed invalid or incomplete records.  
   - Standardized time formats (`HH:MM`) and corrected cross-midnight entries.  
   - Matched each participantâ€™s baseline and intervention data.

2. **Data Integration**  
   - Combined datasets using `combine_data.py`.  
   - Generated unified dataset: `combined_dataset.csv`.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Calculated each participantâ€™s mean **KSS** and **sleep duration**.  
   - Computed **Î”KSS** and **Î”Sleep Duration** (*Intervention âˆ’ Baseline*).  
   - Conducted independent two-sample *t*-tests between groups A and B (*p* < 0.05 as the significance threshold).  
   - Added **compliance rate** as an exploratory covariate.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Generated boxplots of Î”KSS and Î”Sleep Duration using `matplotlib`.  
   - Output files stored in `refactor_outputs/figures/`.

### Behavioral Compliance

To quantify participantsâ€™ adherence to assigned behavioral tasks,  
we define a simple compliance ratio: Compliance rate = (Completed tasks) / (Tasks per day Ã— Days in phase)
- Each intervention phase lasted **7 days**, with **3 tasks per day**,  
  giving a denominator of `3 Ã— 7 = 21`.  
- A task is marked as completed when coded as `1`.

**Example (Group B, one participant):**
| Task | Days Completed | Proportion |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| no_device | 0 / 7 | 0.00 |
| reduce_light | 2 / 7 | 0.29 |
| outdoor_light | 5 / 7 | 0.71 |

**â†’ Overall compliance:** (0+2+5)/21=0.33
We use this compliance rate to interpret between-subject variability in **Î”KSS** and **Î”Sleep Duration**.  
Higher compliance typically reflects stronger behavioral consistency,  
providing an additional layer of reliability when interpreting the outcomes.

### Results Summary
| Metric | Group A Î” | Group B Î” | t-test p |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|
| KSS mean | -0.087 | -0.460 | 0.253 |

Group B (no screen before bed) showed a slightly larger reduction in sleepiness (Î”KSS < 0),  
but the difference was not statistically significant (*p* = 0.25).  
Results suggest behavioral interventions may improve alertness, though further study is needed.

> *n<sub>A</sub>=15, n<sub>B</sub>=13 (participants)*  
> *KSS (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale): 1â€“9, lower scores = greater alertness.*

## Preliminary Results

| Metric | Group A (Fixed Sleep Window) | Group B (No Device Before Bed) | *p*-value | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Î”KSS (Intervention âˆ’ Baseline) | âˆ’0.09 Â± 0.62 | âˆ’0.46 Â± 1.17 | 0.25 | Not significant |
| Î”Sleep Duration (hours) | +0.28 Â± 0.62 | âˆ’0.37 Â± 1.17 | 0.40 | Not significant |

> Although differences were not statistically significant (*p* > 0.05),  
> Group B (No Device Before Bed) showed a slightly larger reduction in sleepiness (Î”KSS â†“),  
> while Group A (Fixed Sleep Window) exhibited a modest increase in sleep duration (Î”Sleep â†‘).  
> These patterns suggest behavioral effects worth exploring in larger-scale studies.

## Limitations and Notes

The data and results in this repository are intended for **educational and exploratory purposes only**.  
Because participantsâ€™ daily routines, environmental factors, and random life events may influence their sleep duration and subjective sleepiness (KSS) ratings, the findings should be interpreted with caution.  

These uncontrolled variables reflect the natural complexity of human behavior and highlight the need for **larger-scale and more controlled studies** in future research.

---

## Future Directions

- Increase sample size to enhance statistical power.  
- Integrate objective physiological data (e.g., HRV, actigraphy).  
- Incorporate **compliance rate** as a covariate in regression modeling.  
- Extend study duration to observe long-term circadian stabilization.

## Data Reliability and Research Transparency

This project follows a transparent and reproducible research workflow to ensure data integrity and validity:

- All participants completed a 7-day baseline phase before intervention, providing within-subject controls.  
- Both subjective (KSS scale) and objective (wearable tracker) data were collected daily at fixed times.  
- Data cleaning steps included outlier removal, missing-value marking, and timestamp standardization.  
- Compliance rate was calculated for each participant to assess data completeness.  
- All scripts, commits, and data revisions are logged in this repository for reproducibility.  
- All data are fully anonymized and used solely for educational and research purposes.
