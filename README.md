# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Hygiene Intervention Study: Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains the cleaned dataset and analysis scripts for my **sleep hygiene intervention experiment**, which examined how different behavioral interventions affect subjective sleepiness (KSS) and sleep duration among young participants aged **18â€“30**.

The project reflects an end-to-end scientific workflow â€” from data collection and cleaning to statistical analysis and reproducibility via GitHub.


## Background

Modern young adults often experience poor sleep quality due to irregular schedules and pre-bed electronic device use.  
This study explores how simple, low-cost behavioral interventions can improve circadian alignment and subjective alertness.

## Study Design

- **Participants**  
  Thirty volunteers (aged 18â€“30) were recruited through online communities.  
  Each participant gave informed consent and received a unique anonymized ID (P001â€“P030).  

- **Experimental Phases**  
  1. **Baseline (5 days):** Participants maintained their usual routines to establish individual sleep baselines.  
  2. **Intervention A â€“ Fixed Sleep Window (7 days):** Participants followed a consistent bedtime and wake-up schedule.  
  3. **Intervention B â€“ No Device Before Bed (7 days):** Participants avoided using electronic devices within 30 minutes before sleep.

- **Measurements**  
  - **Subjective sleepiness (KSS):** Reported at 10:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 9:00 PM daily.  
  - **Sleep onset and wake time:** Self-reported and partially verified via wearable devices.  
  - **Task compliance rate:** Daily completion of assigned tasks (0 = not completed, 1 = completed).


## Daily Task Structure

### Intervention A â€” Fixed Sleep Window
- **on_time_bed:** Go to bed within the designated time window.  
- **no_caffeine:** Avoid caffeine intake after the afternoon.  
- **clean_environment:** Maintain a tidy, cool, and quiet sleep environment.  

### Intervention B â€” No Device Before Bed
- **no_device:** Refrain from using any electronic devices within 30 minutes before sleep.  
- **reduce_light:** Lower environmental light intensity (after 22:30) before bedtime.  
- **outdoor_light:** Ensure at least 30 minutes of natural daylight exposure after getting up.  

Each task was coded as 0/1 and aggregated to compute a **compliance rate** per participant per phase:  

> **Compliance rate = (Number of tasks completed) / (Total assigned tasks)**

This rate served as a proxy for behavioral adherence and was later examined as a covariate when interpreting KSS and sleep-duration changes.

## Methods of Data Processing and Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed invalid or incomplete records.  
   - Standardized time formats (HH:MM) and corrected cross-midnight entries.  
   - Matched each participantâ€™s baseline and intervention data.

2. **Data Integration**  
   - Combined using `combine_data.py`.  
   - Generated unified dataset: `combined_dataset.csv`.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Calculated each participantâ€™s mean KSS and sleep duration.  
   - Computed Î”KSS and Î”Sleep Duration (Intervention âˆ’ Baseline).  
   - Conducted independent two-sample *t*-tests between groups A and B (p < 0.05 as significance threshold).  
   - Added **compliance rate** as an exploratory covariate.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Generated boxplots of Î”KSS and Î”Sleep Duration using `matplotlib`.  
   - Output files stored in `data/cleaned/`.

5. **Behavioral compliance**

We quantify adherence with a simple ratio:

**Compliance rate = completed tasks / (tasks per day Ã— days in phase)**

- Each intervention phase lasts **7 days**, with **3 tasks per day** â†’ denominator = **3 Ã— 7 = 21**.
- A task is counted as completed when it is marked `1`.

**Example (Group B, one participant):**
- `no_device`: **0/7**
- `reduce_light`: **2/7**
- `outdoor_light`: **5/7**  
â†’ **Overall compliance = (0 + 2 + 5) / 21 = 0.33**

We use the compliance rate to interpret between-subject variability in Î”KSS and Î”Sleep Duration.

## Preliminary Results

| Metric | Group A (Fixed Sleep Window) | Group B (No Device Before Bed) | *p*-value | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Î”KSS (Intervention âˆ’ Baseline) | âˆ’0.09 Â± 0.62 | âˆ’0.46 Â± 1.17 | 0.25 | Not significant |
| Î”Sleep Duration (h) | +0.28 Â± 0.62 | âˆ’0.37 Â± 1.17 | 0.40 | Not significant |

> Although differences were not statistically significant, the trend suggested that maintaining a **fixed sleep window** might better stabilize circadian rhythms and reduce subjective sleepiness.

## Limitstions and notes

The data and results in this repository are intended for educational and exploratory purposes only.
Because participantsâ€™ daily routines, environmental factors, and random life events may influence their sleep duration and subjective sleepiness (KSS) ratings, the findings should be interpreted with caution.
These uncontrolled variables reflect the natural complexity of human behavior and highlight the need for larger-scale and more controlled studies in future research.

## Future Directions

- Increase sample size to enhance statistical power.  
- Integrate objective physiological data (e.g., HRV, actigraphy).  
- Incorporate **compliance rate** as a covariate in regression modeling.  
- Extend study duration to observe long-term circadian stabilization.
